# 🔒 Dependency Isolation Strategy Specification
## Mi Rosarita AI Travel App

**Strategy:** Comprehensive Dev/Production Environment Separation
**Security Goal:** Zero production exposure to vulnerable dev dependencies

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

### Current Security Landscape
- **18 high-severity vulnerabilities** in Expo CLI transitive dependencies
- **Primary attack vectors:** Development workflow and build tools
- **Production status:** Runtime dependencies are secure
- **Root cause:** Expo CLI v6.3.12 introduces vulnerable transitive dependencies

### Strategy Overview
Implement a **layered dependency isolation architecture** with:
1. **Development Environment:** Full development tooling with vulnerability monitoring
2. **Production Build:** Minimal, secure runtime dependencies only
3. **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated security gates and build isolation
4. **Migration Path:** Phased rollout with zero development disruption

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Design

### 1. **File Structure Organization**

```
mi-rosarita-ai-app/
├── package.json                 # Main package.json (dev-focused)
├── package.prod.json           # Production-only dependencies
├── package.dev.json            # Dev-only vulnerable dependencies
├── .npmrc                      # Registry configuration
└── scripts/
    ├── build-dev.sh           # Development build script
    ├── build-prod.sh          # Production build script
    ├── security-audit.sh      # Automated vulnerability scanning
    └── setup-dev.sh           # Development environment setup
```

### 2. **Package Organization Strategy**

#### **Current Analysis**
- **Vulnerable Dependencies:** expo-cli (18 vulnerabilities via transitive deps)
- **Secure Runtime:** React Native, Firebase, production dependencies
- **Build Tools:** Metro bundler, Babel presets (some vulnerable)

#### **Isolated Package Files**

**`package.prod.json`** - Production Runtime Only
```json
{
  "name": "mi-rosarita-ai-app-prod",
  "dependencies": {
    // Core runtime dependencies only
    "@expo/metro-runtime": "~3.2.3",
    "@react-navigation/native": "^6.1.18",
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "react-native": "0.74.5",
    // ... other essential runtime deps
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    // Only secure, production-safe dev tools
    "@react-native/babel-preset": "0.74.87",
    "@react-native/metro-config": "0.74.87",
    "metro-react-native-babel-preset": "0.76.8"
  }
}
```

**`package.dev.json`** - Development Environment
```json
{
  "name": "mi-rosarita-ai-app-dev",
  "devDependencies": {
    // Isolated vulnerable development tools
    "expo-cli": "^6.3.12",        // CONTAINS VULNERABILITIES
    "firebase-tools": "^14.15.1",
    "@babel/core": "^7.20.0",
    // ... other dev tools with known vulnerabilities
  }
}
```

---

## 🔧 Build Script Strategy

### **Development Workflow** (Local Development)
```bash
# scripts/build-dev.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Step 1: Install both dev and prod dependencies
npm install
npm install --package-lock-only -g npm-merge-driver

# Step 2: Merge development dependencies
npm-merge-driver merge package.json package.dev.json

# Step 3: Install merged dependencies
npm install

# Step 4: Start development server with security monitoring
echo "🚨 SECURITY: Development environment contains $VULN_COUNT vulnerabilities"
echo "🔒 These vulnerabilities are ISOLATED from production builds"
npm start
```

### **Production Build** (CI/CD Pipeline)
```bash
# scripts/build-prod.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Step 1: Clean install production dependencies only
npm install --production --package-lock-only package.prod.json

# Step 2: Remove dev dependencies from node_modules
npm prune --production

# Step 3: Run security audit on production deps
npm audit --audit-level=high

# Step 4: Build production bundle
npx expo export --platform all

# Step 5: Deploy with security verification
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### **Security-Gated CI/CD Pipeline**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/production.yml
name: Production Build & Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install prod dependencies
        run: npm install --production --package-lock-only package.prod.json
      - name: Security Audit
        run: |
          npm audit --audit-level=high
          if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo "🚨 Security vulnerabilities detected!"
            exit 1
          fi

  build-and-deploy:
    needs: security-scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build production
        run: ./scripts/build-prod.sh
      - name: Deploy
        run: firebase deploy --only hosting,functions
```

---

## 🔒 CI/CD Recommendations

### **1. Automated Security Gates**
- **Pre-build security audit** with zero-tolerance policy
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning** (Snyk, OWASP)
- **Container security scanning** for runtime environments
- **License compliance checking**

### **2. Environment-Specific Deployments**
```yaml
# Firebase deployment configuration
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "dist",
    "ignore": ["**/node_modules/**"],
    "rewrites": [...]
  },
  "functions": {
    "source": "functions",
    "runtime": "nodejs18"
  }
}
```

### **3. Build Environment Isolation**
- **Separate CI runners** for dev vs production builds
- **Network isolation** between build environments
- **Ephemeral build containers** with minimal attack surface
- **Registry access control** for dependency sources

## 📚 Developer Implementation Guide

### **Quick Start for Developers**

#### **1. Environment Setup** (New Developer Onboarding)
```bash
# Step 1: Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd mi-rosarita-ai-app

# Step 2: Setup development environment (with vulnerabilities)
./scripts/build-dev.sh
# 🚨 This will show security warnings - this is expected!

# Step 3: Start developing
npm start
# Development server will start with full tooling
```

#### **2. Understanding the Security Model**
```bash
# 🔒 Production Builds (Secure)
./scripts/build-prod.sh
# Only secure dependencies - ZERO vulnerabilities

# 🔧 Development Environment (Controlled Risk)
./scripts/build-dev.sh
# Full development tools - vulnerabilities ISOLATED from production
```

### **Day-to-Day Development Workflow**

#### **Starting Work**
1. **Pull latest changes**: `git pull origin main`
2. **Update dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Start development**: `npm start` or `./scripts/build-dev.sh`
4. **See security notification**: Accept that dev environment contains known vulnerabilities

#### **Feature Development**
1. **Develop with full tooling**: All Expo CLI tools available
2. **Test locally**: Full development environment
3. **Run security checks**: `./scripts/security-audit.sh` (optional, for awareness)

#### **Before Pushing Code**
1. **Run local tests**: `npm test`
2. **Code formatting**: `npm run format`
3. **Security awareness**: Remember dev dependencies are isolated

#### **Handling Security Updates**
```bash
# When you see security updates for production dependencies
npm audit fix --package-lock-only

# For development dependency vulnerabilities (common)
# These are expected and isolated - no action needed
# Report to security team if they seem concerning
```

### **Production Deployment Workflow**

#### **CI/CD Pipeline (Automated)**
```yaml
# This happens automatically on main branch pushes:
# 1. Security scan of production dependencies
# 2. Build with secure dependencies only
# 3. Deploy to production
# 4. No vulnerable dependencies reach production
```

#### **Manual Production Build** (If needed)
```bash
# Create production build locally
./scripts/build-prod.sh

# Verify security
npm audit --audit-level=high --production

# Deploy artifacts from dist/ directory
firebase deploy --only hosting
```
